🎓 Project Background
This project was developed as part of Harvard's CS50x course. I chose to solve a personal need: managing day-to-day finances without relying on external apps or platforms. It gave me hands-on experience with building web apps from scratch, database design, user authentication, and deploying full-stack applications.

⚠️ Known Limitations
No password reset or encryption (for demo purposes only)
Currently uses a single default currency
Minimal input validation on forms

🚀 Future Improvements
Add budget planning and monthly limits
Visualize expenses using pie/bar charts
Enable multiple currencies and conversions
Add dark mode
Export to CSV or PDF

🧠 Lessons Learned
Learned to integrate Flask routing with HTML templates using Jinja
Gained experience deploying apps on Render and troubleshooting deployment issues (e.g., pytz dependency)
Understood the importance of a clean database schema and user-centric design
Practiced debugging and tracing issues across frontend and backend
